# MyTennisZone

MyTennisZone was my first "big" app I created from scratch. It started out as a fun summer project which was meant to be used to simply track all the stats from tennis matches played with my friends but it slowly got bigger and bigger with more features. It utilizes Firebase Auth and Firestore to allow for users to sign up, add friends, create leagues and tournaments and record match results.
